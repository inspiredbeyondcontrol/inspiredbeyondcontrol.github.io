portfolio site for inspired beyond control

This is my official portfolio of my work in web development and ruby programming.

I currently have my top three projects, starting with a screen recording of my scorekeeper app built in Ruby,
followed by two websites that I built from the ground up. I also created the logo for the Hunger page.

My contact page includes a shortened version of my Resume and a link to contact me via email.
