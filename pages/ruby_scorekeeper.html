        <h3>Ruby&nbsp;Scorekeeper</h3>
        <h4>Description:</h4>
        <p>I built this app with Ruby. The purpose is for keeping track of players' scores. I was inspired to do this while playing a dice game called "Farkle". This particular game has a set winning score, though I also made the app adaptable for other games that don't have a set winning score. So you can use it for other dice games, like Yahtzee, or various card games, like Hand &amp; Foot. It's currently a command-line program, though my next step is to utilize Sinatra or Rails to create a live scoreboard page that will be much more visually&nbsp;appealing.</p>
        <h4>Screen Recording - video&nbsp;1:</h4>
        <p>This first screen recording shows the app being used for Farkle, in which a player has to score exactly 10,000 points to win the&nbsp;game. </p>

        <h4>Screen Recording - video&nbsp;2:</h4>
        <p>This second screen recording shows the app being used for Hand &amp; Foot, a card game in which there is no set winning score. The player with the highest score wins the&nbsp;game.</p>
